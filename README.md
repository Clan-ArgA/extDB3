# extDB3
I have created this repository as an archive to download extDB3, since the repository was closed by bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/torndeco/extdb3/.

A x64 version for Linux is now available! 

I released a new version for Windows that changes small things in the library.

# Description
extDB3 is an Arma3 Addon for connecting to Databases (currently only MariaDB/MySQL).
The main purpose for extDB3 is for persistent missions in Arma.
Note it will require some knowledge about SQF & SQL to use.
extDB3 is also designed to be flexible & secure at the same time.
